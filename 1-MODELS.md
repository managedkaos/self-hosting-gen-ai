# Foundation Models

- [Foundation model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model)

  > A foundation model, also known as large AI model, is a machine learning or deep learning model that is trained on broad data such that it can be applied across a wide range of use cases.
  >
  > Foundation models are general-purpose technologies that can support a diverse range of use cases. Building foundation models is often highly resource-intensive, with the most expensive models costing hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for the underlying data and compute required.[3] In contrast, adapting an existing foundation model for a specific use case or using it directly is much less expensive.

  > Trained on massive datasets, foundation models (FMs) are large deep learning neural networks that have changed the way data scientists approach machine learning (ML). Rather than develop artificial intelligence (AI) from scratch, data scientists use a foundation model as a starting point to develop ML models that power new applications more quickly and cost-effectively.
