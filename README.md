## Glossary of Terms

| **Metric** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| GPT | Generative Pre-trained Transformer |
| LLM | Large Language Model |
| FM | Foundation Model |
| Token | Smallest unit of text used in processing prompts and generating responses (~4 characters) |
| Context length (or context window) | Maximum amount of information an LLM can take as input for a query |
| Latency (ms) | Amount of time the FM uses to generate each token in a sequence |
| Input token count | Number of input tokens used by the FM during inference |
| Output token count | Number of tokens generated in a response by an FM |
| Time to first token | Amount of time between the client's request being received and the first token sent in response |
| Tokens per second | Rate at which the model is able to generate a response |
