## The Rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence

### 2022
- [Introducing ChatGPT, (OpenAI, November 30, 2022)](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/)

  > We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.
  >
  > ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
  > 
  > We are excited to introduce ChatGPT to get users’ feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses. During the research preview, usage of ChatGPT is free. Try it now at chatgpt.com(opens in a new window).

- [The advent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT may be the most important news event of 2022 (Forbes, December 12, 2022)](https://fortune.com/2022/12/12/openai-chatgpt-biggest-news-event-of-2022/)

  > Russia's invasion of Ukraine tops most lists of important news events in 2022, and President
Volodymyr Zelensky is not only Time's Person of the Year, but also everyone else's. But the last
couple of weeks have convinced me the honor may belong to something else: Open AI's ChatGPT.

- [A new AI chatbot might do your homework for you. But it's still not an A+ student (NPR, December 19, 2022)](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/19/1143912956/chatgpt-ai-chatbot-homework-academia)

  > After the developer OpenAI released the text-based system to the public last month, some educators have been sounding the alarm about the potential that such AI systems have to transform academia, for better and worse.
  >
  > "AI has basically ruined homework," said Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.

### 2023

- [On ChatGPT’s one-year anniversary, it has more than 1.7 billion users—here’s what it may do next (CNBC, November 30, 2023)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/chatgpts-one-year-anniversary-how-the-viral-ai-chatbot-has-changed.html)

  > Over the past year, people have used ChatGPT for all sorts of tasks, from writing emails to sprucing up resumes to even creating a six-figure business.
  > 
  > As the ways people utilize the AI chatbot have changed, the technology itself has evolved too.

- [The Year of ChatGPT and Living Generatively (Wired, December 1, 2023)](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-chatgpt-year-of-living-generatively/)

  > In November last year, OpenAl launched a "low key research preview" called ChatGPT. What happened next transformed the tech industry-and perhaps humanity's future.
